<summary>Quick overview</summary>
<div markdown=1>
&nbsp;   
   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Objective._ Developed a Python-based First Expired, First Out (FEFO) model that uses an ETL pipeline to publish waste projections, providing transparency and improving decision-making in menu planning, supply planning, and purchasing.       

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Approach._ Data Extraction: Pulled and merged inventory data from various internal systems (e.g., DWH, Google Sheets). Adapted to operational constraints (time dependency based on location). Integrated information on expiration dates, inventory batches, and product handling timeframes.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Data Processing._ Extracted Inventory and current Purchase Order data from the DWH, as well as demand data. Allocated inventory to demand by applying the FEFO logic to prioritize products by their expiration date. Determined what inventory would be consumed and what remaining and by which date. Uploaded the resulting data to the DWH.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Visualization & Insights._ Built visual dashboards (Tableau) and tracker-reports (Top 5 logs) to support project management and decisions across operational stakeholders.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Results._ Efficiency: Enabled accurate and timely decisions to reduce waste. Scalability: The FEFO model is adaptable across various markets and product categories. Impact: Led to more informed menu planning, helping align purchasing volumes with real-time expiration risks; cost savings: 17.000€/w.
