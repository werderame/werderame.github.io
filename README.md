## Hi, I’m Filippo 👋
Welcome to my GitHub!
I’ve always been curious about how things really work, which led me to study **philosophy** and eventually dive deep into **data** while working in **supply chain**. I've always had a passion for the technical side of things—working with data feels like the most exciting way to solve a problem, and I love finding solutions to complex challenges. Still I think there is also a fascinating world of people and processes to be explored-eventually the design of a technical solution must make life easier for operational teams and decision-makers alike. 

### 🌱 A Bit About Me
I’m a person who thrives on **learning** and **growth**. I’m always on the lookout for new skills, particularly those related to data, technology, and problem-solving. Whether it’s exploring a new tool, refining my code, or building something from scratch, I enjoy building and the process as much as refining the outcome. My work revolves around building tools and pipelines and my stack contains

Outside of work, I’m a big fan of **climbing**. Since moving to Berlin, I’ve been bouldering regularly. It’s a humbling sport—the better you get, the harder it is to break through to the next level. But that’s part of the appeal for me. It’s a challenge that keeps me coming back, no matter how tough it gets.

### 🤝 What I’m Looking For
I'm excited about continuing my journey in the field of data and leverage my passion for operations and processes. The big dream would be to become a data scientist and contribute to developing cool tools that help businesses I believe in to achieve more people and greater products. For now, my focus is on acquiring ever more experience and tools in the field of Analytics and Engineering, and become an invaluable contributor and a colleague.

I look forward to chatting with you -feel free to get in touch.

### Selected Projects
#### ♻️ FEFO Waste Projection Model (@ HelloFresh)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Objective._ Developed a Python-based First Expired, First Out (FEFO) model that uses an ETL pipeline to publish waste projections, providing transparency and improving decision-making in menu planning, supply planning, and purchasing.

&nbsp;  
   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Approach._ Data Extraction: Pulled and merged inventory data from various internal systems (e.g., DWH, Google Sheets). Adapted to operational constraints (time dependency based on location). Integrated information on expiration dates, inventory batches, and product handling timeframes.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Data Processing._ Extracted Inventory and current Purchase Order data from the DWH, as well as demand data. Allocated inventory to demand by applying the FEFO logic to prioritize products by their expiration date. Determined what inventory would be consumed and what remaining and by which date. Uploaded the resulting data to the DWH.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Visualization & Insights._ Built visual dashboards (Tableau) and tracker-reports (Top 5 logs) to support project management and decisions across operational stakeholders.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Results._ Efficiency: Enabled accurate and timely decisions to reduce waste. Scalability: The FEFO model is adaptable across various markets and product categories. Impact: Led to more informed menu planning, helping align purchasing volumes with real-time expiration risks; cost savings: 17.000€/w.

#### 📦 Packaging Licencing Fee Calculator (@ HelloFresh)
Automated a dynamic pipeline integrated with Google Sheets and the DWH to calculate packaging disposal and recycling fees. The tool aggregates data from multiple sources, automates calculations, and outputs results to Tableau, saving ~10 man-hours/month and €120,000/month through improved accuracy. 
Lots more nerdy information over here..
